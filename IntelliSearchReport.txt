## Supporting Data and Evidence

Simo HÃ¤yhÃ¤ is considered the deadliest sniper in history, with at least 505 confirmed kills [7]. Some sources claim he had at least 542 kills in just 98 days [5]. HÃ¤yhÃ¤ used a Finnish-made M/28-30 rifle and a Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun [5]. Vasily Zaitsev was a celebrated sniper who fought in the Battle of Stalingrad [6]. He earned the nickname "White Death" and is considered arguably the most prolific sniper of all time [10]. Vasily Zaytsev, a Soviet sniper, is noted for 242 kills in four months and is considered one of Russia's most skilled marksmen [8].
