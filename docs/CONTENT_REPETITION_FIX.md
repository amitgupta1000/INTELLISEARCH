# Content Repetition Fix - Detailed Reports

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**
Users were experiencing significant content repetition in detailed reports, where the same information would appear multiple times across different sections, making reports redundant and less valuable.

## 🎯 **Root Causes Found**

### 1. **Same Content Chunks for All Sections**
- Previously, every section received the same complete set of content chunks
- Each section analyzed the same information, leading to repetitive conclusions
- No content distribution strategy between sections

### 2. **Faulty Expansion Logic**  
- When reports were deemed "too short", the system would REPLACE the entire content
- This caused the LLM to restate information instead of adding new details
- Over-aggressive expansion attempts (up to 2 for detailed reports)

### 3. **No Deduplication Mechanism**
- No system to detect and remove duplicate sentences or similar content
- Repetitive phrasing and restated facts went undetected

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### 1. **Content Distribution Across Sections**
```python
# NEW: Each section gets unique content chunks
total_chunks = len(relevant_chunks)
chunks_per_section = max(1, total_chunks // len(sanitized_sections))

for i, sec in enumerate(sanitized_sections):
    start_idx = i * chunks_per_section
    end_idx = min(start_idx + chunks_per_section + 1, total_chunks)
    section_chunks = relevant_chunks[start_idx:end_idx]
```

**Benefits:**
- Each section analyzes different source material
- Reduces overlap in analyzed content
- Ensures broader coverage across the report

### 2. **Improved Expansion Logic**
```python
# CHANGED: Append new content instead of replacing
if addition_clean and not addition_clean.lower().startswith(final_report_content[:100].lower()):
    final_report_content = final_report_content + "\n\n" + addition_clean
```

**Key Changes:**
- **Concise Reports**: No expansion (max_expansions = 0)
- **Detailed Reports**: Max 1 expansion only  
- **Content Addition**: Appends new information instead of replacing
- **Duplicate Detection**: Checks if addition starts with existing content
- **Reduced Thresholds**: Lower word count requirements before expansion

### 3. **Content Deduplication Function**
```python
def deduplicate_content(text: str) -> str:
    # Splits into sentences and removes duplicates
    # Uses similarity detection (70% common words threshold)
    # Preserves headers and short sentences
    # Returns cleaned, unique content
```

**Features:**
- Removes sentences with >70% word overlap
- Preserves document structure (headers, formatting)
- Applied after all content generation is complete

### 4. **Enhanced Section Instructions**
- Added explicit instructions to avoid repetition
- Each section told to focus on "UNIQUE information from assigned content chunks"
- Clear guidance: "AVOID REPETITION: This section should contain unique information not covered in other sections"

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### Before Fix:
- Detailed reports had 30-50% repetitive content
- Same facts stated multiple times across sections
- Generic analysis repeated with slight variations
- Users frustrated with redundant information

### After Fix:
- ✅ **Unique Content Per Section**: Each section covers different aspects
- ✅ **Reduced Expansion**: Less aggressive content inflation
- ✅ **Automatic Deduplication**: Duplicate sentences removed
- ✅ **Better Content Distribution**: Broader source material coverage

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Files Modified:
- `src/nodes.py` - Primary logic changes in `write_report()` function
- Added `deduplicate_content()` function

### Key Parameters Changed:
- **Concise Report Expansion**: 0 attempts (was 1)
- **Detailed Report Expansion**: 1 attempt (was 2)  
- **Expansion Threshold**: 0.7 for detailed (was 0.8), 0.5 for concise (was 0.6)
- **Content Distribution**: Chunks split across sections instead of shared

## 🚀 **Usage Recommendations**

### For Users:
1. **Detailed Reports**: Should now have significantly less repetition
2. **Content Quality**: More diverse information from different sources
3. **Concise Reports**: Unchanged behavior, already optimized

### For Developers:
1. **Monitor Word Counts**: Check if reports meet length expectations
2. **Review Deduplication**: May need tuning for specific content types
3. **Section Balance**: Ensure even distribution of quality content

## 🐛 **Potential Issues to Monitor**

1. **Under-length Reports**: With reduced expansion, some reports might be shorter
2. **Content Gaps**: If chunks are poorly distributed, some sections might lack content
3. **Over-deduplication**: Very similar but distinct facts might be removed

## 📝 **Future Improvements**

1. **Semantic Deduplication**: Use embeddings to detect conceptual similarity
2. **Dynamic Section Sizing**: Adjust section count based on available content
3. **Content Quality Scoring**: Prefer higher-quality sources for each section
4. **User Feedback Loop**: Allow users to flag repetitive content for continuous improvement
