# Package Updates Summary

## Missing Packages Added

Based on the application testing, the following packages were missing and have been added:

### 1. requests-html (>=0.10.0)
- **Purpose**: Web scraping with JavaScript support
- **Issue**: Application was failing to scrape many URLs due to missing requests_html module
- **Status**: ✅ Added to requirements.txt and batch files

### 2. pypdf (>=4.0.0)
- **Purpose**: PDF document processing
- **Issue**: PDF processing was failing with "pypdf package not found" error
- **Status**: ✅ Added to requirements.txt and batch files

### 3. ratelimit (>=2.2.1)
- **Purpose**: Rate limiting for API calls
- **Issue**: Original `ratelimiter` package incompatible with Python 3.13 (asyncio.coroutine removed)
- **Solution**: Replaced with `ratelimit` package which is Python 3.13 compatible
- **Status**: ✅ Updated requirements.txt and batch files

## Files Updated

### requirements.txt
- Added `requests-html>=0.10.0`
- Added `pypdf>=4.0.0` 
- Replaced `ratelimiter>=1.2.0` with `ratelimit>=2.2.1`

### run_intellisearch.bat
- Updated core package installation section
- Updated document processing section
- Fixed rate limiting package

### run_intellisearch_clean.bat
- Updated core package installation section
- Updated document processing section  
- Fixed rate limiting package

## Dependency Conflicts Resolved

### websockets Version Conflict
- **Issue**: requests-html required websockets<11.0, but google-genai required websockets>=13.0
- **Solution**: Prioritized google-genai requirements (websockets>=13.0,<15.1.0)
- **Impact**: requests-html may have limited functionality, but core scraping works with fallback methods

## Testing Results

✅ **All critical packages now import successfully**
✅ **Application runs without fatal errors**
✅ **LLM utils module loads with all dependencies**
✅ **Web scraping functional (with fallbacks for requests-html conflicts)**
✅ **PDF processing enabled**
✅ **Rate limiting functional**

## User Actions Required

**None** - All changes have been automatically applied to:
- requirements.txt
- run_intellisearch.bat
- run_intellisearch_clean.bat

Users can simply run the batch files and all dependencies will be installed correctly.

## Notes

- The application now has robust fallback handling for scraping when requests-html encounters issues
- PDF processing is fully functional
- Rate limiting works with Python 3.13 compatible package
- All batch files will install the correct package versions automatically
