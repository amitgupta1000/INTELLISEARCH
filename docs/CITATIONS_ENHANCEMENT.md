# Citations and References Enhancement

## üéØ **Feature Overview**
Added a comprehensive citations section to all reports that provides proper academic-style source attribution without affecting the word count limits for concise or detailed reports.

## ‚úÖ **Key Features Implemented**

### 1. **Separate Citations Section**
- Automatically generated at the end of every report
- Clearly marked with "üìö Sources and References" header
- Explicitly noted as excluded from word count: *"Note: This section is not included in the report word count."*
- Professional formatting with numbered citations and full URLs

### 2. **Numbered Citation System**
- In-text citations use academic standard: [1], [2], [3], etc.
- Automatic mapping of source URLs to citation numbers
- Citations are referenced throughout the report content
- Examples:
  - `"According to the study [3], market grew by 15%"`
  - `"The value is $2.4 billion [1], representing a 12% increase [2]"`
  - `"As stated in [4], 'direct quote from source'"`

### 3. **Enhanced Content Instructions**
- LLM receives citation numbers with each content chunk
- Explicit guidance to use numbered citations for all major claims
- Proper citation format instructions for quotes and data points
- Maintains academic writing standards throughout

### 4. **Word Count Exclusion**
- **Citations section completely excluded** from word count calculations
- **Concise reports**: Stay within 1,200 words for main content
- **Detailed reports**: Stay within 3,000 words for main content
- **Additional value**: Professional citations without affecting report length
- **Clear separation**: Citations added after deduplication and final word count checks

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### Core Functions:
```python
def generate_citations_section(relevant_chunks) -> tuple[str, dict]:
    # Returns: (formatted_citations_text, source_url_to_number_mapping)
    
def deduplicate_content(text: str) -> str:
    # Content deduplication applied before citations are added
```

### Process Flow:
1. **Generate source mapping** before section creation
2. **Distribute content chunks** with citation numbers to sections  
3. **Section generation** with numbered citation instructions
4. **Content deduplication** applied to main report content
5. **Citations generation** and appending (excluded from word count)
6. **Final word count check** on main content only
7. **Save with citations** included in files but not counted

### Key Technical Details:
- **Citation mapping** created once and reused across all sections
- **Truncation handling**: Citations regenerated if content is truncated
- **Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of citation generation process
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback if citation generation fails
