# Requirements.txt Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The `requirements.txt` file contained Python code at the end, which caused pip installation failures.

### Problematic Code Found:
```python
# Check if FAISS is available
try:
    from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
    faiss_available = True
except ImportError:
    faiss_available = False
    FAISS = None
```

### Why This Caused Problems:
1. **Invalid Format**: requirements.txt files should only contain package specifications
2. **Pip Parser Error**: pip couldn't parse the Python code, causing installation failures
3. **Dependency Conflicts**: Failed parsing triggered pip's dependency resolver, causing downgrades and conflicts

## Solution Applied
Removed the Python code from `requirements.txt`, keeping only proper package specifications.

### Batch File Flow (Now Fixed):
1. ✅ Individual package installation (works correctly)
2. ✅ Core packages installed successfully
3. ✅ LangChain packages installed successfully  
4. ✅ Provider packages installed successfully
5. ✅ Additional packages installed successfully
6. ✅ requirements.txt installation (now works without conflicts)

## Verification
- ✅ `python -m pip check` - No dependency conflicts
- ✅ requirements.txt parsing - Valid format confirmed
- ✅ Python code moved to appropriate location (nodes.py where FAISS detection belongs)

## Result
The batch file will now:
- Install packages successfully without uninstalling them
- Avoid dependency conflicts caused by malformed requirements.txt
- Provide a smooth installation experience for users

The installation process should now work correctly without the confusing install→uninstall→reinstall cycle.
